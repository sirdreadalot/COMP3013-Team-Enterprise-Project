Our project is a isometric tower-defence game, based on the traditional template for the genre with our own twist.
The game will contain: various types of enemies with their own buffs and abilities; elemental towers which have the capabilities to interact and merge together to create new and exciting effects that can inspire different playstyles; player currency, having gold as the main currency to buy towers and upgrades, as well as various types of gems (tbd) which can allow the player to upgrade towers/buildings into more exciting variants.
